Fine-Tuning a Large Language Model for Cryptography Expertise

Objective:
The objective of this task is to fine-tune an open source locally run large language model, such as Llama or MPT, on specific data related to the field of cryptography. 
The resulting model should be an expert in cryptography and capable of generating high-quality responses related to cryptographic concepts, algorithms, and applications.

Requirements:

1. Assemble a comprehensive dataset for training and validation:
	* Collect relevant training data from various sources, including academic papers, technical documents, and discussion forums focused on cryptography such as https://crypto.stackexchange.com.
	* Include examples of high-quality responses related to cryptographic concepts, algorithms, and applications.
	* Create a separate validation set consisting of input-output pairs to evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model.
2. Fine-tune the language model:
	* Preprocess the collected data to ensure it is compatible with the language model's input format.
	* Fine-tune the pretrained language model on the cryptography-specific training dataset, optimizing for metrics such as perplexity or cross-entropy loss.
	* Monitor the model's performance on the validation set during fine-tuning to avoid overfitting and ensure generalization.
3. Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model:
	* Assess the quality of the fine-tuned model's responses using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, or BLEU score.
	* Compare the performance of the fine-tuned model with the original pretrained model and other relevant baselines, such as pure document embedding and semantic search.
	* Conduct qualitative evaluations by examining a subset of the model's responses to ensure they are accurate, informative, and contextually relevant.
4. Improve and iterate on the model:
	* Identify areas where the fine-tuned model can be further improved or lacks expertise.
	* Iterate on the training dataset, adding more data or adjusting the data distribution to address identified weaknesses.
	* Fine-tune the model again and reevaluate its performance using the same metrics and criteria as before.
5. Documentation and reporting:
	* Document the entire process, including data collection, fine-tuning parameters, evaluation metrics, and results.
	* Prepare a report that summarizes the project, its objectives, methodology, results, and any limitations or potential future work.

1. Comparative Analysis with Document Embeddings and Vector Search:

In addition to the primary deliverables, include a comparative analysis of the fine-tuned language model with traditional document embeddings and vector search techniques used in similar tasks. This analysis will highlight the advantages and limitations of using a large language model for cryptography expertise compared to more traditional approaches.

To conduct this analysis:

a. Generate document embeddings for a subset of the training dataset using established algorithms, such as Doc2Vec or BERT.
b. Perform vector search on the generated document embeddings to retrieve relevant information related to input queries. Compare the results with the responses generated by the fine-tuned language model for the same queries.
c. Analyze the performance, relevance, and quality of the retrieved documents and language model responses. Evaluate factors such as accuracy, coverage, and readability.
d. Discuss the potential advantages and limitations of using a large language model versus document embeddings and vector search for tasks in the field of cryptography.

Include this comparative analysis in the final report, providing insights into the relative merits and drawbacks of both approaches.

Integration with Password Cracking Tools:
One potential application of the fine-tuned language model specialized in cryptography is the creation of context-based passwords. Given a specific context, such as a person's favorite movies or hobbies, the model can generate plausible password options that would be relevant to that context. By using these context-based passwords, users can create more memorable and secure passwords, while still maintaining a level of uniqueness that makes them difficult to crack using brute force attacks.

To integrate the language model with password cracking tools such as Hashcat, the generated password options can be fed into the tool alongside other wordlists or input formats supported by the software. This integration allows hashcat to utilize the context-based passwords as potential candidates for cracking encrypted passwords, enhancing the overall effectiveness of the password recovery process. It is important to note that while this approach may improve the chances of successfully recovering passwords, users should still follow best practices for password security and employ additional defense mechanisms such as slow hashing and salted passwords to protect their data.




Deliverables:

* A set of python notebooks that can be reused for creating the dataset, fine-tuning  and validation
* The fine-tuned language model specialized in cryptography.
* A comprehensive dataset of training and validation data.
* A detailed report on the project, including documentation and evaluation results.
